# üß™ Budget-Friendly Home Lab Series

A low-cost, practical cybersecurity lab environment built entirely with free tools, open-source platforms, and evaluation software ‚Äî designed to help you level up your skills in system administration, network security, SIEM monitoring, vulnerability management, and more.

This project follows my YouTube series, **"Budget-Friendly Home Lab,"** where each episode walks through deploying, configuring, and integrating components of a realistic enterprise lab on a budget.

## üß© Core Components

- **Oracle VirtualBox** ‚Äì Free hypervisor for running all VMs locally
- **pfSense** ‚Äì Open-source firewall/router for network segmentation
- **Windows Server 2019** ‚Äì Evaluation version used for AD DS and DNS
- **Ubuntu/Debian** ‚Äì Lightweight Linux clients
- **Wazuh** ‚Äì Open-source SIEM for threat detection, auditing, and compliance
- **Windows/Linux Clients** ‚Äì For endpoint testing, policy application, and log collection

## üéØ Learning Objectives

- Build a secure, isolated home lab using VirtualBox
- Understand core network services like DHCP, DNS, NAT, and VLANs
- Deploy and manage Windows Server with AD DS
- Perform basic blue-team activities (alerting, logging, monitoring)
- Practice ethical red-team tools in a controlled space
- Integrate open-source tools to simulate enterprise-level SOC workflows

## üöÄ Getting Started

To follow along, you‚Äôll need:

- A host machine with at least 16GB RAM
- Oracle VirtualBox (or your preferred hypervisor)
- Internet connection for downloading ISOs and packages

All instructions assume **VirtualBox** as the hypervisor, but the core principles apply to other platforms like VMware or Proxmox.

## üìÅ Repo Structure

This repository will be updated with:

- `/docs/` ‚Äì Lab setup notes, screenshots, diagrams
- `/configs/` ‚Äì Sample configurations (pfSense, AD DS, Wazuh, etc.)
- `/scripts/` ‚Äì Any automation or helper scripts
